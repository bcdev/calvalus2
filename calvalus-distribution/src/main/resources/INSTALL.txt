Calvalus Installation Instruction (Version 1.7)
-----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
To use the Calvalus software a Java JDK 1.8 from Oracle is required.
Apache Hadoop has to be of Version 1.x.
Both software packages have to be installed on all nodes of the cluster.
A Namenode and a Tasktracker service have to be running.

The Calvalus software archive consist of:
 - the Calvalus software bundle
 - the SNAP software bundle
 - the CPT (Calvalus production tool)
 - a sample configuration file for the CPT ("calvalus.config")

The CPT tool can be used to install/uninstall software bundle and processing request.
For a more detailed description see chapter 7 of the Software User Manual.

To let the CPT know with which cluster it should connect the
supplied "calvalus.config" should be adapted.

It is mostly sufficient to change the hostname of the Namenode and the Tasktracker.
These are the configuration keys: "calvalus.hadoop.fs.default.name" and "calvalus.hadoop.mapred.job.tracker"
The adapted configuration file should then be placed into
the directory $HOME/.calvalus/ of the user that uses the CPT tool.

The CPT tool is a Java JAR containing all required dependencies. It can be invoked with:

java -jar cpt.jar

For help:
java -jar cpt.jar --help

The remaining step is to install the SNAP and the Calvalus bundle into the HDFS:

java -jar cpt.jar --deploy snap-bundle/*.jar snap-2.0.0
java -jar cpt.jar --deploy calvalus-bundle/*.jar calvalus-2.14-SNAPSHOT

Whereas the name of the SNAP and Calvalus bundle are given in the "calvalus.hadoop.calvalus.calvalus.bundle" and
the "calvalus.hadoop.calvalus.snap.bundle" configuration property.

To validate the bundle deployment you can use the "hadoop fs" tool:
hadoop fs -ls /calvalus/software/1.0

This should list two sub-directories.

To do actual processing one or more processor bundles are required.
They are not part of this software archive.
