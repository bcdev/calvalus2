<h4>CoastColour processor version 1.7</h4>
<font size="2">
    The new CoastColour processor is available in CoastColour's Calvalus system for on-demand processing.
    It generates CoastColour L1P, L2R and L2W products.
    For small regions it can also be combined with ICOL for correction of the adjacency effect.
    The region, time period, and processing parameters can be defined by users.

<h4>MERIS FR L1B v2013</h4>
<font size="2">
    The recently reprocessed dataset of MERIS full resolution (v2013) is available as input for CoastColour processing.
    The dataset has been geo-corrected with AMORGOS 4.0 and is used as MERIS FSG for CoastColour processing.
    <p/>
    A further quality check of this dataset has been requested and is currently performed by ESA and the IDEAS team to
    blacklist files that have obvious issues.
    The current v2013 dataset still contains products with issues that had been identified and removed in the previous
    dataset.

<h4>CoastColour on-demand processing</h4>
<font size="2">
    CoastColour has replaced its online archive of products of predefined regions by a Calvalus on-demand processing
    system.
    Users specify time period, region, and processing parameters.
    The selected data are processed automatically on the Calvalus cluster.
    The results are made available for download via HTTP or for further processing.
    <p/>
    Spatial and temporal selection
    <ul>
        <li>The region can be defined by polygon or bounding box, or it can be selected from one of the former 26
            predefined regions.
        </li>
        <li>It is recommended to limit the size of the region to what is required.
        </li>
        <li>The time period can be specified by start and end day.
        </li>
        <li>It is recommended to split larger periods into several periods, e.g. one per month or at most per year.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Processor selection
    <ul>
        <li>The CoastColour L2W processor can start from MERIS L1B products, process with all three processors in a
            pipeline, and generate L2W in a single processing call.
            This will succeed for small regions.
        </li>
        <li>For larger regions it is necessary to first process L1P, and to use the output to process L2R, and from that
            to process L2W. Output datasets can be used as inputs for subsequent processing by selecting "Show my
            outputs" in
            the L2 processing form. The L2R processor accepts MERIS L1B or CoastColour L1P products. The L2W processor
            accepts MERIS L1B, CoastColour L1P or L1P products.
            To do it all in one step will fail for larger regions because of resource consumption.
        </li>
        <li>When using ICOL the region to be processed must be small.
            Else, processing will take very long or will even fail because of resource consumption.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Download and cleanup
    <ul>
        <li>You should estimate the download size before submitting a production request.
            Example: One month of L2W of the Baltic Sea is about 30 GB.
        </li>
        <li>Processing time may vary depending on the current load on the Calvalus cluster.
            If there are no other projects processing at the same time processing one year of data for one CoastColour
            region may take a few hours.
            Usually download times will be longer than processing times.
        </li>
        <li>After downloading please remove your entry from the production management.
            This will release the storage of the results and will allow others to process and download as well.
        </li>
    </ul>
