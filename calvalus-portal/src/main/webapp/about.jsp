            <h1>The ESA Calvalus Study</h1>


            <h2>Objective</h2>

            <p><img src="images/product-development-cycle.png" width="240" height="209" vspace="4" align="right"
                    alt="Product development cycle"><a href="http://www.esa.int/esaEO/">ESA's Earth Observation (EO)</a>
                missions provide a unique dataset
                of observational data of our environment. Calibration of
                the measured signal and validation of the derived products is an extremely important task for efficient
                exploitation
                of EO data and the basis for reliable scientific conclusions. In spite of this importance, the cal/val
                work is often
                hindered by insufficient means to access data, time consuming work to identify suitable in-situ data
                matching the EO
                data, incompatible software and limited possibilities for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. In
                view of the
                future fleet of satellites and the fast-growing amount of data produced, a very efficient technological
                backbone is
                required to maintain the ability of ensuring data quality and algorithm performance.</p>

            <p>The announcement of opportunities EO Cal/Val and User Services is a technology study of the
                <a href="http://smeprojects.esa.int/TechnologyforSMEs.asp">ESA LET-SME</a> 2009 call,
                investigating into an existing leading edge technology (LET) for their applicability in the EO domain.
                Specifically,
                LET-SME is a spin-in instrument encouraging the participation of SMEs to ESA technology. The LET-SME
                focuses on
                early stage development of <strong>Leading Edge Technologies</strong>, i.e. the ones likely to become
                the reference
                technologies
                for the near future, and have good chances of being infused into ESA projects and missions. </p>

            <p>In accordance with the study's statement of work, Calvalus is a system that has been proposed to fully
                support the
                idea of LET-SME, thus
                with a strong focus on a selected LET which is described in this report.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>

            <p><img src="images/cluster-hardware.png" style="float:left; margin-right:12px;"
                    alt="The cluster"><a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult GmbH</a> proposed to
                develop a <strong>demonstration
                    processing system</strong> based the <strong>MapReduce programming model</strong>
                (MR) combined with a <strong>Distributed File System (DSF)</strong>. The basic approach was first
                published in 2004 by the two
                Google
                computer scientists J. Dean and S. Ghemawat
                (<em><a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on
                    Large
                    Clusters</a></em>).
                The technology has been designed for processing of ultra large amounts of data and is based on massive
                parallelisation of tasks combined with a distributed file system, both running on
                large, extensible clusters solely comprising commodity hardware. All nodes in the cluster are equally
                configured and
                provide both disk storage and CPU power. Well known online services provided by Google, Yahoo, Amazon
                and Facebook
                rely on this technology. Its spin-in application to space born, spatial data is feasible and pertinent.
                <img src="images/map-reduce.png"
                     style="float:right; margin-right:24px;margin-left:12px;" alt="Map reduce"><br>
                The results
                of this
                study demonstrate that the processing of large amounts of EO data using MR and a DSF is efficient and
                advantageous.
                The demonstration system, Calvalus, basically comprises a <strong>cluster of 20 commodity
                    computers</strong> with a total disk
                capacity
                of <strong>112 TB</strong> at a total cost of <strong>30 k&euro;</strong>. The processing system
                software is based on
                <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a>, an open-source
                implementation of MR and DSF in Java and <a href="http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/">SNAP</a>,
                an ESA Earth Observation Toolbox and Development Platform.</p>

            <p>Calvalus gains its performance from <strong>massive parallelisation of tasks</strong> and the <strong>data-local
                execution</strong> of
                code. Usual
                processing clusters or grids first copy input data from storage nodes to compute nodes, thereby
                introducing I/O
                overheads and network transfer bottlenecks. In Calvalus, processing code is executed on cluster nodes
                where the
                input data are stored. Executable code can be easily deployed; the code distribution and installation on
                all cluster
                nodes is done automatically. Multiple versions of processing code can be used in parallel. All these
                properties of
                the Calvalus system allow users to efficiently perform cal/val and EO data processing functions on whole
                mission datasets, thus allowing an <strong>agile EO data product development</strong> and <strong>fast
                    improvement cycles</strong>.</p>

            <p>The different production scenarios and analyses implemented in Calvalus are inspired by the needs of the
                current ESA
                projects, such as <a href="http://www.coastcolour.org/">CoastColour</a> and
                <a href="http://www.esa-cci.org/">Climate Change Initiative (CCI)</a> for Land Cover and Ocean Colour,
                both of
                strong interest to an international user community. The implementation is focused on
                the <a href="http://www.ioccg.org/">Ocean Colour</a> data processing and validation:</p>

                that allows users to order and monitor productions according
                the to four production scenarios, and to finally download the results. It also offers a Java production
                API, allowing developers to write new production scenarios.
